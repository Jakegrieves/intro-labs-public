    "# Lab 5: Text Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab explores a new dataset for text classification tasks using naïve Bayes and logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Outcomes\n",
    "* Be able to train and test naïve Bayes and logistic regression classifiers using scikit-learn.\n",
    "* Know how to apply evaluation metrics to the classifiers and display examples of misclassifications.\n",
    "* Be able to examine learned model parameters and explain how each classifier makes a decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load a new Twitter dataset, which is described in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.12421.pdf), then extracts feature vectors from each sample.\n",
    "1. Training and evaluating naïve Bayes using Scikit-learn.\n",
    "1. Training and evaluating logistic regression using Scikit-learn.\n",
    "1. Optional extension: lemmatization and bigram features.\n",
    "1. Optional extensions: lexicon features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How To Complete This Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "Read the text and the code then look for 'TODOs' that instruct you to complete some missing code. Look out for 'QUESTIONS' which you should try to answer before moving on to the next cell. Aim to work through the lab during the scheduled lab hours. To get help, you can talk to TAs or the lecturer during the labs, post questions to Blackboard (anonymously) or on Teams in the QA channel (with your name), or ask a question in the Wednesday live sessions. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you work through the notebooks, please make a note of any code that is unclear to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The labs *will not be marked*. However, they will prepare you for the coursework, so try to keep up with the weekly labs and have fun with the exercises! To understand what's going on inside the methods we use here, make sure to watch the lecture videos for the same week."
